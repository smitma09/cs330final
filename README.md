# CS 330 Final
This repository contains code for my final project for CS 330 (Internet Programming) class at Luther College (taken in the spring of 2016). The assignment was to create a web application using the Flask application framework. Requirements included:
  -Having at least 3 controllers (Python functions with @web.route decorators)
  -Having at least 3 views (templates)
  -Using the SQLAlchemy plugin, creating a database with 3-4 tables, including at least one one-to-many or many-to-one relationship
  -Deploying the project to a free hosting site
  -Encorporating WTForms to process data
  -Use of Bootstrap templates
  
Having a love for the game of baseball, I decided to use a database of baseball statistics and implement an API for viewing stats for a certain player. I have used Baseball Reference (www.baseball-reference.com) as a tool for researching and lookup up information on baseball players in the past, and I used that as a motivating factor in creating my project. I utilized a database of Major League Baseball statistics that was created by Sean Lahman and made publically available at http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics. The database includes information and statistics ranging back to the 1870s. In my final version of my project, you can view statistics/information of anybody that has played in or managed a game in the MLB since 1871, as well as view statistics of any team in MLB history. The database in this repository is accurate through the 2014 season.
